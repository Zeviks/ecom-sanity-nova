[How to create a schema]

When creating a schema, we simply export default an object.

Inside of that object, we first provide the name of our schema 

Then we give the object the fields property, which is an array of objects.
Each object is a field inside of the schema. 

We simply create the field with its appropriate name, title, type, etc. 
Refer to the documentation for more details.
